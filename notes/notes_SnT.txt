##Terminology

* Job: indexed by correlative number and production line.
* Route: indexed by correlative number and vehicle.
* Patient: indexed by correlative number and center.

##Alternatives

A. two steps: 

1. (re)Assign appointments to routes.
2. (re)Asign production to routes.
3. Iterate.

B. Make time discrete 
    * (model everything at the same time?)
    * P_(t, i) => number of doses produced in timeslot `t` and line `i`.
    * 
    
C. Work with job production: index everything by the job where it was produced.
    
    Demand:
    * route_job_patient_(j, r, p) => patient `p` is covered by a dose produced in job `j` and transported in route `r`.
        * constraints: radioactivity, times, availability, ...
    
    Transport:
    * route_start_times_(r) => time when route `r` starts from production node.
        * vehicle availability.
    * route_arcs(r, c1, c2) => route `r` passes through `c1` before going to `c2`.
        * constraints: travel times + distances.
    * route_arivals_(r, h) => time when route `r` passes through hospital `h`
        * v01RouteHospital_(r, h) => if route `r` passes through hospital `h`.
        * constaints: travel times, start of route.        
        
    Production:
    * job_start_times_(j) => start (end) time for job `j`.
        * constraints: line availability.
    * job_type_(j) => assignment of job to a production line.
        * constraints: job_start, job_end, production, radioactivity, job_used, costs, etc.
    * line_used_(l) => if a job is used in a production line, then the production is used
    * job_used_(j) => if a job is used, it uses its line and costs time and has a type.
    
    Auxiliar:
    * vQTransport_(j, r) => job `j` has X number of doses in route `r`.
        * constraints: start of route.
    * v01Demand_(j, p) => patient `p` is covered by a doses from job `j`.
        * constraints: time, route.

##Magnitudes

**Heuristic solution**

* routes: 46
* jobs: 108

**Data**

* patients: 315
* possible pairs of centers: 25

Potential size for:

* v01TransportProductionDemand_: 46 * 108 * 315 = 1 564 920 vars.
* v01RouteSequence: 1150 vars.
* 
        
##Solution

1. Production:
    * start time for each production.
    * type of production.
1. Transport: 
    * route for each vehicle.
    * dosis for each route.
1. Demand satisfaction:
    * production-transport-patient.
