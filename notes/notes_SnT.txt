##Alternatives

A. two steps: 

1. (re)Assign appointments to routes.
2. (re)Asign production to routes.
3. Iterate.

B. Make time discrete 
    * (model everything at the same time?)
    * P_(t, i) => number of doses produced in timeslot `t` and line `i`.
    * 
    
C. Work with job production: index everything by the job where it was produced.
    * vQTransport_(j, l, r) => job `j` from line `l` has X dosis in route `r`.
        * constraints: start of route. 
    * v01Demand_(j, l, p) => patient `p` is covered by a dosis from job `j` from line `l`.
        * constraints: time, route.
    * vStartJob_(j, l) (vFinishJob_(j, l)) => start (end) time for job `j` in production line `l`.
        * constraints: line availability.
    * vTimeVisit_(r, h) => time when route `r` passes through hospital `h`
        * v01RouteHospital_(r, h) => if route `r` passes through hospital `h`.
        * constaints: travel times, start of route.
    * vStartRoute_(r) => time when route `r` starts from node.
        * vehicle availability.

##Solution

1. Production:
    * start time for each production.
    * type of production.
1. Transport: 
    * route for each vehicle.
    * dosis for each route.
1. Demand satisfaction:
    * production-transport-patient.
