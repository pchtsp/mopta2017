1. What's the planning horizon? => depends on the examination times (T_j)?
2. Fixed costs: fixed to what horizon? => all the horizon of the problem?
3. The i in production lines: are these the same line in different production plans? or different lines that work in parallel?
    we assume i means "each element" of the set P.
4. Is there any capacity for vechicles? We assume they are not constrained.
5. At what time the production plants can start? any time? before demand starts? the day before?
5. Does the RP degrade inside the factory and inside the vehicle?
6. At what time can the production lines start working? can we assume we have a stock of very radioactive material at the beginning?
