**Production lines**

* We understand there's four lines and four types of production "jobs" and that these are different concepts. Any production line can do any "type of job". When we say job type we mean a combination of p_i, a_i and b_i. So, for example, job type 2 takes 30 min to produce 100 dosages of 120 units of radioactivity. Is this correct? Can a line have jobs from any type and change from working on one job to another without cost?

**Data** 

* Is there any other data set we can use? Is the solution going to be tested with another data set?
* Is there an example of a (maybe a bad) solution? So we know the format of the output? If we share a solution could you tell us if it at least is feasible or has the correct format?

**Transport**

* Should we assume that all vehicles have to return to the production node at the end of the trip?
* Can two vehicles unload at the same time in a hospital? Can they leave at the same time from the production node?
